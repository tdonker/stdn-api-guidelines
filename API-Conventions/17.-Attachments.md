## MUST use multipart/form-data when combining data of several types in one body [91]
Multipart request combine one or more sets of data into a single body, separated by boundaries.
You typically use these requests for file uploads and for transferring data of several types in a single request (for example, a file along with a JSON object)
In OpenAPI 3, you describe a multipart request in the following way:
```yaml
requestBody:
  content: 
    multipart/form-data: # Media type
      schema:            # Request payload
        type: object
        properties:      # Request parts
          id:            # Part 1 (string value)
            type: string
            format: uuid
          address:       # Part2 (object, for example image metadata)
            type: object
            properties:
              street:
                type: string
              city:
                type: string
          profileImage:  # Part 3 (an image)
            type: string
            format: binary
```
The example above corresponds to the following request:
```
POST /upload HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 428
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=abcde12345
--abcde12345
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="id"
Content-Type: text/plain
123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000
--abcde12345
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="address"
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "street": "Blaak",
  "city": "Rotterdam"
}
--abcde12345
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="profileImage "; filename="image1.png"
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
{…file content…}
--abcde12345--
```
## MUST add Content-Disposition to the request header [92]
API consumer must add the Content-Disposition to the request header when calling the API.
In case of a file, both the name and filename fields are mandatory.

## MUST validate Content-Disposition name and filename are provided in the request header [93]
API provider must validate the existence of both the name and filename are provided in the request header.

## SHOULD use binary format for the attachment type [94]
