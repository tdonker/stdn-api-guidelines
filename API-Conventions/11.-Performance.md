##	SHOULD support partial responses via filtering [51]

Depending on your use case and payload size, you can significantly reduce network bandwidth need by supporting filtering of returned entity fields. Here, the client can explicitly determine the subset of fields he wants to receive via the fields query parameter.
The fields parameter has the following syntax: `fields=<field name>[[,<field name>]]`. Field names are separated by commas: ,. Requesting a resource without explicitly specifying the desired field names, will return the whole object defined in the response definition.
