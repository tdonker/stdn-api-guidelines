## API First

API First is part of the Stedin integration strategy. Integration guidelines for the integration strategy can be found here: [Integratie richtlijnen v2.0.pptx](https://stedingroep.sharepoint.com/sites/scs-apd001/01/Gedeelde%20%20documenten/API-management/Integratie%20richtlijnen%20v2.0.pptx)

- define APIs first, before coding its implementation, using a standard specification language
- get early review feedback from peers and client developers

By defining APIs outside the code, we want to facilitate early review feedback and also a development discipline that focus service interface design onâ€¦

- profound understanding of the domain and required functionality
- generalized business entities / resources, i.e. avoidance of use case specific APIs
- clear separation of WHAT vs. HOW concerns, i.e. abstraction from implementation aspects
- APIs should be stable even if we replace complete service implementation including its underlying technology stack

## Use events and callbacks for specific scenario's

API Manager = Azure API Management

Message Broker = Azure ServiceBus (and Azure EventGrid)

## Sector guidelines

The conventions closely follow the sector guidelines but may deviate. The Stedin conventions are leading. For reference, our guidelines may be annotated with:

- *AO-n*: "MFF BAS API Ontwerprichtlijnen v3.0 (vastgesteld)", EDSN/NEDU, *n*-th item
- *UR-n*: "MFF BAS URI Richtlijnen v2.0", EDSN/NEDU, *n*-th item

If an API will be made available within the sector, those APIs require review by the *API review group*. Contact your solution architect integration for this.

## Additional notes

All integrations (including temporary APIs) need to conform to the conventions. Exceptions require agreement by the Design Authority Integration and if indicated as such the Architecture Board.
